# RISC-Processor

Completed as part of lab module of UBC CPEN 211. 

This project implements a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture, focusing on simplicity and efficency to gain proficiency in SystemVerilog and simulation tools like Quartus and ModelSim. It was first written in SystemVerilog and tested using rigourious testbenches before implementing on the DE1-SoC development board. This project has a fully functional datapath, cpu, regfile, ALU logic, control units and memory interfaces. These enable communication with the outside world using memory mapped I/O.
